# Tic Tac Toe

## Description:  
Play the famous Tic Tac Toe with your friends. You only need two players. 
React project made to exercise state management and passing it from child to parent components and viceversa.

### How to run: 
Load the index.html within the folder or go to [the project page](https://topaiin.github.io/tictactoe/)

### Roadmap:
Custom naming for players: I would add an input field to the Board component so any player can add his/her name and personalize the user experience. 
Winning Board: The implementation of the Winning Board will be as well in the Board component. I would add an array that contains the number of winning times each player has historically. In the future, when we learn how to manage databases, i would like this to be saved so the game can show the top 10 players of all time.
